# Environment Setup for PDF Export System

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://vwhwufnckpqirxptwncw.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InZ3aHd1Zm5ja3BxaXJ4cHR3bmN3Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzkzODI5MjAsImV4cCI6MjA1NDk1ODkyMH0.Wjw8MAnsBrHxB6-J-bNGObgDQ4fl3zPYrgYI5tOrcKo
```

## Installation

Run the following commands to install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @react-pdf/renderer @supabase/supabase-js date-fns
```

## Scripts

Make sure your package.json includes these scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}
```

## Testing

Visit `/dev/pdf-preview` to test the PDF generation system with demo data.

## Database Setup

The required tables and storage bucket have been created via migration:

- ✅ `documents` storage bucket
- ✅ `quotes` table with RLS policies
- ✅ `quote_items` table with RLS policies  
- ✅ `company_profile` table with RLS policies
- ✅ `customers` table (if didn't exist)

## Security Notes

Note: There are existing RLS security warnings in your database that are unrelated to this PDF export system. The new tables I created have proper RLS policies enabled. You should review and fix the other tables' RLS policies as recommended by the Supabase linter.
