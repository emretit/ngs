Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding our business model. Below are the detailed answers to your questions:

## 1. Who are the users that will use the paid subscriptions, features, and services in the app?

Our app is designed for **businesses and companies (B2B model)**, not individual consumers. The users who purchase paid subscriptions are:

- Technical service companies (electrical, electronics, appliance, HVAC services)
- Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) operating in Turkey
- Commercial enterprises that need sales, purchasing, and inventory management
- Service coordinators and technicians who manage field services

Each subscription is tied to a company account and can be used by multiple employees within that company. Our subscription plans are:
- **Free Plan:** 1 user, basic features
- **Business Plan:** 10 users, advanced features - 999 TRY/month
- **Enterprise Plan:** Unlimited users, all features - Custom pricing

## 2. Where can users purchase the features and services that can be accessed in the app?

Users purchase subscriptions and features **exclusively through our web application** at https://pafta.app, not within the mobile app.

**Purchase Process:**
- Users access our web application (https://pafta.app)
- Navigate to Settings > Subscription & Billing
- Select their desired plan (Free, Business, or Enterprise)
- Complete payment via Iyzico payment gateway (a licensed payment provider in Turkey)
- All payments are processed through the web browser, not in the mobile app

**Important:** Our mobile app does **not** use in-app purchases (IAP). The mobile app only provides access to features that were previously purchased through the web application. Users cannot make any purchases or payments within the mobile app.

## 3. What specific types of previously purchased features and services can a user access in the app?

Users can access features in the mobile app based on their subscription plan purchased on the web:

**Free Plan:**

## 4. What paid content, subscriptions, or features are unlocked within your app that do not use in-app purchase?

**All subscriptions and features are purchased through our web application and do not use in-app purchases.**

The paid content accessible in the mobile app (but purchased outside the app) includes:

- **Feature unlocks:** Advanced CRM, E-Invoice integration, Quote & Order Management, Custom reports, API access (Enterprise), Custom integrations (Enterprise), Increased storage, Priority support
- **User limit increases:** Business plan allows 10 users (vs. 1 in Free), Enterprise allows unlimited users

**Why we don't use in-app purchases:**
- Our app is a B2B business management system
- Subscriptions are company-based and typically sold through annual contracts
- Payments are processed through Iyzico on the web (common payment method in Turkey)
- Business requirements for invoicing and accounting make web-based payments necessary
- The mobile app serves as an access tool, not a purchase platform

This model complies with Apple's Guideline 3.1.1, which allows apps to provide access to content purchased outside the app, as long as no purchases are made within the app itself.

**Target Audience:**

- Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
- Corporate customers

**Subscription Structure:**
- Each subscription is tied to a **company account**

- Subscriptions are **company-based**, not individual user-based

**Enterprise Plan Sales:**
- Enterprise plans are typically sold through direct sales discussions
- Usually sold through **annual contracts**
- Payments are made through the web application to meet invoicing and accounting requirements
