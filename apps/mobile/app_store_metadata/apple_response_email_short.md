Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your inquiry. Below are the answers to your questions:

## 1. Who are the users that will use the paid subscriptions, features, and services in the app?

Our app is a **B2B business management system** for companies, not individual consumers. Users who purchase subscriptions are:

- Technical service companies
- Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in Turkey
- Commercial enterprises needing sales, inventory, and service management

Subscriptions are company-based and can be used by multiple employees. Plans: Free (1 user), Business (10 users, 999 TRY/month), Enterprise (unlimited users, custom pricing).

---

## 2. Where can users purchase the features and services that can be accessed in the app?

Users purchase subscriptions **exclusively through our web application** at https://pafta.app, **not in the mobile app**.

- All payments are processed via Iyzico payment gateway on the web
- The mobile app does **not** use in-app purchases (IAP)
- The mobile app only provides access to features purchased on the web

## 3. What specific types of previously purchased features and services can a user access in the app?

Users access features based on their web-purchased subscription:

**Free Plan:** 1 user, basic CRM, limited service management, 5 GB storage

**Business Plan (999 TRY/month):** 10 users, advanced CRM, E-Invoice integration, Quote & Order Management, 50 GB storage, priority support, plus mobile features: service requests, technician assignment, digital signatures, PDF generation, maps, push notifications

## 4. What paid content, subscriptions, or features are unlocked within your app that do not use in-app purchase?

**All subscriptions are purchased on the web and do not use in-app purchases.**

Unlocked features include:
- Business Plan (999 TRY/month) and Enterprise Plan subscriptions
- Advanced CRM, E-Invoice integration, Quote & Order Management
- Increased user limits (10 users for Business, unlimited for Enterprise)
- API access, custom integrations, priority support

**Why no IAP:** This is a B2B system with company-based subscriptions. Payments are processed on the web via Iyzico for business invoicing requirements. The mobile app is an access tool, not a purchase platform. This complies with Guideline 3.1.1.

## 5. Are the enterprise services in your app sold to single users, consumers, or for family use?

**Enterprise services are sold exclusively to businesses and companies (B2B), not to individual users, consumers, or families.**

- Each subscription is tied to a company account
- Multiple employees can use the same subscription
- Designed for business use only
- Typically sold through annual contracts via direct sales
- Payments made through web application for invoicing/accounting needs

**Additional Info:**
- Web: https://pafta.app

The mobile app syncs subscription status from our backend and grants access based on the web-purchased plan.
